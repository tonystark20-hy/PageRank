# PageRank
This PySpark implementation demonstrates the PageRank algorithm, which is used to measure the importance of nodes in a graph. It leverages PySpark's distributed computing capabilities to compute the PageRank of nodes within a large-scale graph.

## Overview
PageRank is a link analysis algorithm used by Google Search to rank web pages in search engine results. It assigns a numerical weight to each element of a hyperlinked set of documents, with the purpose of measuring its relative importance within the set.

## Features
* Distributed Computation: Utilize PySpark's distributed computation model to calculate PageRank across a distributed environment.
* Graph Representation: Represent the graph using PySpark RDDs or DataFrames to perform iterative computations for PageRank.
* Convergence Criteria: Implement convergence criteria to stop the iterative process when PageRank scores stabilize.
* Adjustable Parameters: Configure parameters like damping factor, number of iterations, etc., to fine-tune the PageRank algorithm.

## Prerequisites
* Python installed in your environment.
* Apache Spark and PySpark set up on your local machine or a cluster.
